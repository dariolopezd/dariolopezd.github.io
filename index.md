# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

# About Myself 
I am a Master's and Ph.D. in Physical Sciences with a strong background that encompasses Pure Mathematics, Statistics, Programming, and Physics of the highest standard. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist alongside an international group of physicists called [PhyData](https://phydata.github.io/). We carry out projects focused on the Python language, with an emphasis on machine learning, and we assist in the integration of scientists in the field. Additionally, I do research in the area of Theoretical Physics where I have published highly impactful manuscripts and have collaborated with pioneering international groups in the field. I currently hold the position of Associate Professor at the Institute of Physics at [PUCV](https://pucv.cl/), where I teach Python programming and Physics for the Computer Engineering program.

## As Data Scientist   
I have undertaken various projects to enhance my skills as a Data Scientist, covering diverse areas such as medical data, Netflix data, environmental data, Bitcoin prices, and user data from webpages. These projects are implemented using Deepnote notebooks, which are published on Deepnote and also available as repositories on GitHub.

## As Researcher 
I work as a Theoretical Physicist specializing in the areas of Supergravity and Black Holes. My manuscripts have been published in highly impactful journals, and I collaborate with pioneering international scientists.

In this manuscript, we found new regular black holes solutions coupled with solitons of AdS Chern-Simons Supergravity. The solitons exhibit non-trivial topology, creating a soliton/anti-soliton system. Remarkably, at its extremal point, the black hole transforms into a BPS (Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield) solution of the theory, a characteristic that enables us to establish energetic stability for the black holes.
